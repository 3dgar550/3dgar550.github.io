## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 7

I really enjoyed this lab and it was probably my favorite lab because it was my first partner that really helped me when I needed help and was willing to communicate. He explained really well how to use defensive programming to write a program that validates command line input.

*Lab 8

This lab was great because me and my partner were struggling at first to get the codes right. We were able to get it done and I thought he was a nice person to talk to and a nice guy to work with. It was a useful and productive lab. Writing the loop that iterates through all commands was the hardest part but we asked to the TA for help and he helped us understand more. Using loops to process wasn't that diffult for us 

*Lab 11

It was my second time getting this partner and it was a good lab. We talked a lot about coding and he showed me the notes he had and we even talked about life outside of the classroom and overall a really good experience working with him. We would write the code and when we would make test and make format errors would pop up and my partner make sure to show and tell me what I did wrong and we would run it and it would run perfect.
