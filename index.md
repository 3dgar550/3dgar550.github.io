## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 7

I really enjoyed this lab and it was probably my favorite lab because it was my first partner that really helped me when I needed help and was willing to communicate. He explained really well how to use defensive programming to write a program that validates command line input.

*Lab 8

This lab was great because me and my partner were struggling at first to get the codes right. We were able to get it done and I thought he was a nice person to talk to and a nice guy to work with. It was a useful and productive lab

*Lab 11

It was my second time getting this partner and it was a good lab. We talked a lot about coding and he showed me the notes he had and we even talked about life outside of the classroom and overall a really good experience working with him.
